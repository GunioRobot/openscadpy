Description: python script file based graphical CAD environment
 OpenSCADpy is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It focuses on CAD
 aspects rather than artistic ones.
 .
 OpenSCADpy is not an interactive modeller. Instead it is something like a
 3D-compiler that reads in a PYTHON script file that describes the object and
 renders the 3D model from this script. This gives the designer full control
 over the modelling process and enables him to easily change any step in the
 modelling process or make designes that are defined by configurable
 parameters.
