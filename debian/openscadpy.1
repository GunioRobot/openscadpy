.SH SYNOPSIS
.B openscadpy
.RI [ options ]
.RI [ file ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the \fBopenscadpy\fP command.
.PP
\fBopenscadpy\fP is a software for creating solid 3D CAD objects. It focuses on
CAD aspects rather than artistic ones.

OpenSCADpy will start as a graphical program unless export options are given (see
below). For the usage of the GUI and a description of the OpenSCAD Python extension
 see the examples.
.SH OPTIONS

.TP
\fB\-s\fP \fIfile.stl\fP, \fB-o\fP \fIfile.off\fP, \fB-x\fP \fIfile.dxf\fP
Export the given file as STL, OFF or DXF, respectively. If any of these options
is given, the GUI will not be started.
.TP
\fB\-d\fP \fIfile.deps\fP
If the \fB-d\fP option is given, all files accessed while exporting are written
to the given deps file in the syntax of a Makefile.
.TP
\fB-m\fP \fImake_command\fP
If a nonexisting file is accessed during OpenSCADpy's operation, it will try to
invoke \fImake_command missing_file\fP to create the missing file, and then
read it again.
.TP
\fB-D\fP \fIvar=val\fP
This option can be used to assign constant values to OpenSCADpy variables. The
variable's value is an expression, so if this mechanism is used to assign
strings, care has to be taken that the shell does not consume quotation marks.
More than one \fB-D\fP options can be given.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Show version of program.
